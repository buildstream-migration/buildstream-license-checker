bst_license_checker 0.1
=======================

First release of Buildstream License Checker

  o Checks out the sources of selected elements.
  o Invokes Licensecheck to scan the sources for license information.
  o Summarises output in machine-readable and human-readable output files.
  o Also scans elements' recursive dependencies (--deps none, run, or all).
  o Caches scan results in the working directory, so they can be reused in
    future if the element hasn't changed.
  o Ignores elements if they're named in an ignore list (useful for saving time
    on elements like stack elements, with no sources to check out).
  o Works with Buildstream 1 and Buildstream master (autodetects which one is
    currently installed, and uses correct commands for that version).
